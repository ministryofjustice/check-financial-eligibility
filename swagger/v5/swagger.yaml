        Adds details of an applicant's capital assets to an assessment.

        There are two types of assets:

        - bank_accounts The description should hold the Bank name and account
          number, and the value should hold the lowest balance during that calculation period (i.e. the
          month leading up to the submission date)

        - non-liquid capital items: These are other capital assets which are not immediately realisable as cash, such
          as stocks and shares, interest in a trust, valuable items, etc. Do not include property or vehicles which
          are added through separate endpoints.
